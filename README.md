Welcome to ME 344 - Introduction to High Performance Computing!

### Cluster Setup

The instructions for the Cluster Setup project are located in the `cluster_setup` directory. There you will need to use the appropriate file which contains instructions to set up the cluster that you have been assigned. For example, if you're assigned cluster 1, you would use the `cluster_1.md` file.

**NOTE:** It's extremely important that you use the correct file!

Here is the [link to the sign-up sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tmq5s4A-cio_XLNkw5xMbdSkjok1WIYOc8ldOF-C79g/edit?usp=sharing) in case you forgot your week or cluster. Make sure to only work on the cluster that you are assigned on the week you are assigned!
